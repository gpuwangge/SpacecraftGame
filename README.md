# SpacecraftGame

This is an extended project for MSU CSE471 by Xiaojun Wang

I extended the class project and combined it with an innovated particle system to simulate fire, explosion, smoke and laser effect.

I stop working on this one because XNA is no longer supported by Microsoft. Will move on with other game engine.

Assets(object meshes, sound and part of the code) are from CSE473 websites by Professor Charlies Owen from Michigan State University. (https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse473/Syllabus.pdf)
